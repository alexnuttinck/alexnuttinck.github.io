&lt;p&gt;It happened during a mission for a client.
They had decided to move everything to AWS, hoping to scale faster and more easily than with their old bare-metal self-hosted infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At first, everything looked perfect. Deployments were smoother, scaling was instant, and everyone was proud of how modern it all felt.
The promise of “infinite scalability” seemed within reach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But then, the invoices started growing.
Each month, the costs climbed higher, and every time the cluster expanded, the bill followed.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Reproducibility Crisis</title><link>https://alexnuttinck.dev/posts/1-the-reproducibility-crisis/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://alexnuttinck.dev/posts/1-the-reproducibility-crisis/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This one goes back to one of my very first missions.
I arrived at the client’s office, full of energy, ready to dive into their development environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I asked the classic first question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Can I get access to the dev environment?”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer? A USB key.
Inside it, a virtual machine image, several gigabytes of it, along with a Word document as the only piece of documentation for the setup. No Git repository, no configuration management, &amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Adventures in Uptime</title><link>https://alexnuttinck.dev/posts/adventures-in-uptime/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Oct 2025 09:00:00 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://alexnuttinck.dev/posts/adventures-in-uptime/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Adventures in Uptime is a comic series born from real-life stories I’ve experienced during my years working in IT as a sysadmin and DevOps engineer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a humorous take on the sometimes absurd, always unpredictable world of technology, where coffee machines crash, servers live under desks, and “everything is a priority.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to capture those everyday anecdotes we all laugh about later. The kind of moments that every engineer, sysadmin, or office worker has lived at least once.
So I decided to turn them into comics.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
