The kind of moments that every engineer, sysadmin, or office worker has lived at least once. So I decided to turn them into comics.\nEach story is told in four panels, short and punchy. Sometimes the comics are purely technical, sometimes they poke fun at office culture, but they all come from real experiences (mine or those shared by colleagues).\nI also wanted to explore what’s possible with AI, using tools like Sora, to generate visuals that bring these moments to life while keeping that clean, expressive comic style I love.\nCreating Adventures in Uptime has been a lot of fun! A mix of nostalgia, experimentation, and geek humor. It’s my way of saying: even when systems crash, coffee spills, and priorities multiply… there’s always something to laugh about.\nHere is the cover:\n","date":"October 12, 2025","hero":"/images/blog/adventures-in-uptime/banner.png","permalink":"https://alexnuttinck.dev/posts/adventures-in-uptime/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eAdventures in Uptime is a comic series born from real-life stories I’ve experienced during my years working in IT as a sysadmin and DevOps engineer.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s a humorous take on the sometimes absurd, always unpredictable world of technology, where coffee machines crash, servers live under desks, and “everything is a priority.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI wanted to capture those everyday anecdotes we all laugh about later.

I arrived at the client’s office, full of energy, ready to dive into their development environment.\nSo I asked the classic first question:\n“Can I get access to the dev environment?”\nThe answer? A USB key. Inside it, a virtual machine image, several gigabytes of it, along with a Word document as the only piece of documentation for the setup.
