We had a Christmas Sweater Day at the office with colleagues.
Let’s just say... that day was particularly inspiring. 😄

This also feels like a good moment to slow things down a bit.
There won’t be any new Adventures in Uptime stories next week.
But don’t worry, I still enjoy creating these little comic strips just as much, and there will be more to come in 2026!

Enjoy the holidays, take care of yourselves, recharge (systems included), and see you soon for more uptime adventures. 🎄✨
