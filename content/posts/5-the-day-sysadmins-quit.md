This story is inspired by something very real: the invisible work of system administrators.

Their job isn’t to ship new features or flashy updates, it’s to make sure that everything just works.
Servers stay up, backups run, emails flow, and systems stay secure.
Most of it happens quietly, behind the scenes, where no one really notices... until something breaks.

Unfortunately, some managers don’t see that.
When they don’t understand the technical side, they think "nothing’s happening."
Micromanagement takes over, trust disappears, and appreciation fades.
And eventually, the sysadmins decide to leave. Because, let’s be honest, there’s no shortage of work for skilled people elsewhere.

Then what happens next?
Well... that’s where my imagination begins. 😅
Servers crashing, chaos in the office, smoke in the datacenter, the whole empire crumbling without its silent guardians.

It’s funny in the comic, but painfully real in many places.
System administrators keep the digital world running, often without thanks, until the moment they’re gone.

Maybe it's time we appreciate uptime before it disappears.
