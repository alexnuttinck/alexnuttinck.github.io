description: Adventures in Uptime is a humorous comic series inspired by real-life moments from my IT career — from sysadmin days to DevOps chaos. Each story is told in four panels, capturing the funny, frustrating, and all-too-familiar side of tech life. I created it to share my experiences (and a few scars) with humor, while experimenting with what AI can bring to creative storytelling.

Adventures in Uptime is a comic series born from real-life stories I’ve experienced during my years working in IT as a sysadmin and DevOps engineer.

It’s a humorous take on the sometimes absurd, always unpredictable world of technology, where coffee machines crash, servers live under desks, and “everything is a priority.”

I wanted to capture those everyday anecdotes we all laugh about later — the kind of moments that every engineer, sysadmin, or office worker has lived at least once.
So I decided to turn them into comics.

Each story is told in four panels, short and punchy, like a slice of life from the trenches of uptime.
Sometimes the comics are purely technical, sometimes they poke fun at office culture — but they all come from real experiences (mine or those shared by colleagues).

I also wanted to explore what’s possible with AI — using tools like Sora to generate visuals that bring these moments to life while keeping that clean, expressive comic style I love.

Creating Adventures in Uptime has been a lot of fun — a mix of nostalgia, experimentation, and geek humor.
It’s my way of saying: even when systems crash, coffee spills, and priorities multiply… there’s always something to laugh about.
