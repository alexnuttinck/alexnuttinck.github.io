We’ve all been in that meeting.
The one where the manager stands in front of a whiteboard covered in sticky notes, eyes wide with excitement.

> "Okay team. These are all top priority tasks!"

You scan the board.
"Urgent."
"Critical."
"Do Now."
"Top Priority."

Every single item is flagged as essential. Every feature is a must-have. Every bug is a showstopper.

When you ask the logical question: "If they are all priority one, which one do we do first?". You get the classic answer:

> "Simple: just multitask everything."

It’s the great paradox of project management.
Prioritization is supposed to be about choosing what *not* to do right now. But sometimes, it feels like the strategy is just "do everything, immediately."

As the saying goes: **When everything is a priority... nothing is.** 😅
