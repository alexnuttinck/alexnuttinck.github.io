I was browsing LinkedIn and a few other platforms, looking for sysadmin or system engineer positions.
Nothing. Or almost nothing.

It turns out that “System Administrator” is apparently too old-school now.
The title seems to have quietly disappeared, replaced by an explosion of new ones:
DevOps Engineer, Cloud Engineer, Platform Engineer, Site Reliability Engineer, Cloud Architect...
and even Operations Ninja.

All these roles sound different, yet when you read the job descriptions, they all seem to mean the same thing.
Run servers, automate stuff, fix things, you know, the usual.

It’s like someone fed an AI the phrase "System Administrator" and asked it to generate 50 trendier versions. 😅

In the end, whether you call it DevOps, SRE, or "Cloud-Native Synergy Architect", the mission hasn’t changed:
keep the systems alive and the lights on.

Disclaimer: I obviously know that the role of a system administrator has evolved and specialized into many new fields over time: DevOps, SRE, Platform Engineering and beyond.
The title generator joke was too good to resist. 😄
