It’s a classic scene in any office... but even more so in IT. Caffeine consumption is high, dependency is real, and when the coffee machine goes down, everything suddenly becomes a critical incident.

What always makes me laugh is how seriously teams treat it, almost like a real outage (including myself 😅). Emergency discussions, improvised failover plans, desperate workarounds... All for a working espresso.

Sometimes, the most critical infrastructure isn’t your servers, it’s whatever keeps the humans running. ☕
