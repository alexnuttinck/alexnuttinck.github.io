Remote work has invited us into everyone’s homes. We’ve all seen the kitchen counters, the unmade beds in the background, or the cats walking across keyboards.

But during a video call, I witnessed a setup that truly redefined "dedication."

I called a colleague for a quick sync. When his video feed popped up, I didn't see a home office or a living room. I saw wooden planks, a lawnmower, and a shovel hanging on the wall.

He was sitting in his garden shed. 🏚️

Wrapped in a heavy coat, wearing a beanie and (I’m not kidding) mittens, he was typing away. I could almost see his breath in the cold air.

> "Welcome to my office," he said, smiling through the shivers.

Apparently, the house was too chaotic (or perhaps his partner had politely "suggested" him to find a quieter place to work). So, he exiled himself to the garden.

"My hands are freezing," he admitted, "but the Wi-Fi signal is surprisingly strong!"

It was the ultimate trade-off: hypothermia for bandwidth.
